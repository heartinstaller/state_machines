Productive time calculator application based on Arduino UNO. User defined time set by the key inputs, the total productive time is then stored into the persistant memory of UNO and can be cleared with the combination of key inputs. Increase time, decrease time, abort, start, pause, stats, erase productive time, edit ongoing countdown, etc functionality is provided using only 3 keys either by signle or combination of key inputs. When set time reaches to zero buzzer functionality implemented!
